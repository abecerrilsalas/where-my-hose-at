## Description

*✨ Where My Hose At ✨* solves the problem of not having a driveway—something that apartment-dwellers don't typically have access to.

💦🏡🐈‍⬛🪴🛠🚙☀️🧺

What is a driveway? It's a place where projects get tackled! Driveways can be the perfect outdoor project zone. It's where you can use a hose and other tools not fit for a small living space, and tackle chores that require ventilation—or just extra space so you can focus less on the mess, and more on getting the task done.

Sometimes you just need a flat surface where you can be an automechanic to your car.
Or maybe you really need to wash out your cat's litter box.
It's a simple solution to simple problems.

And if you're a driveway-owner—think of lending your driveway as a service to your community… and also, when you're out of town, wouldn't it be nice to make it seem like your house isn't unoccupied? 👀
